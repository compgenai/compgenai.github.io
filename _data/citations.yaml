  description: 'This study identifies the RNA helicase HEL-1 as a regulator of longevity
    in C. elegans by specifically activating the DAF-16/FOXO signaling pathway. HEL-1
    is essential for lifespan extension under reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling and
    functions as a co-regulator of DAF-16 target genes, suggesting conserved mechanisms
    for RNA helicases in mammalian aging.

    between membrane and soluble proteins, with 67% of soluble domains structurally
    resembling known soluble proteins and 41% of soluble proteins sharing domains

  description: 'This study demonstrates that network rewiring is a key mechanism driving
    changes in gene essentiality between species. Comparative analysis of yeast and
    mouse shows that nonessential yeast genes become essential in mouse through increased
    network connectivity in protein complexes, reinforcing the centrality-lethality
    rule in evolutionary contexts.
