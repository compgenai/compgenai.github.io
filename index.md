The Computational Genomics & AI Lab at Inha University develops machine learning models to decode the functional regulatory logic embedded in DNA sequence, with applications spanning human complex diseases and synthetic biology. We focus on building interpretable, high-resolution frameworks that connect genetic variation to function and phenotype across both single-cell and population-level data.
