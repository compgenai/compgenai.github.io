At the Computational Genomics & AI Lab, we develop machine learning models that predict gene expression and phenotypic outcomes directly from sequence information—advancing the field of sequence-to-function prediction. Our work centers on single-cell and population-scale omics data, which we integrate with genomic sequence features to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.
